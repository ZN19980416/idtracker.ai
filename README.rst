trajectorytools is a library with some utils to study and
plot 2D trajectories.

Installation
============

To install requirements:
.. code-block:: bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

To install the package:

.. code-block:: bash
pip install .
 
It is possible to install it locally with a symlink:
  
.. code-block:: bash
pip install -e .
   
In the folder "examples", you can find some example scripts. They
